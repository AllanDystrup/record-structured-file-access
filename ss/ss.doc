 *
 *
 * =============================== SEARCHING =================================
 *
 *
 * A fundamental operation intrinsic to a great many computational tasks is
 * SEARCHING : retrieving some particular information from a large amount of
 * previously stored data. Normally we think of the information as divided
 * into smaller BLOCKs, each block having a KEY for use in searching.
 *
 * The task may be formulated directly as "find the index of the BLOCK
 * identified by the KEY K in an array of BLOCKs", or it may be camouflaged
 * in different ways, for instance as as a request to "retrieve the RECORD in
 * a file corresponding to the record-KEY K".
 *
 * No matter how camouflaged, the task eventually boils down to finding a
 * solution to the general searching problem, for which we have several well
 * known algortihms, cf. Knuth[1977].
 *
 *
 *                         Sequential search.
 * A simple "brute force" method where we simply scan a table of keys from
 * one end, until we "hit" K (or exhaust the table). Only suitable when the
 * number of keys is small (< approx. 20).
 * Worst case.... : n, where n = the table size
 * Average case.. : (n+1)/2
 * Example,n=1000 : W=1000, A=500
 *
 *                         Binary search.
 * This method requires an ORDERED table (sorted numerically or alphabetically).
 * We now recursively look at the middle of the table, each time discarding
 * the upper/lower half of the table depending on the value of K (less/greater
 * than the middle entry). The algorithm requires more bookkeeping, but
 * guaranties a low search time in both the worst and average case (in fact
 * binary search is provably the best possible algorithm for a COMPARISON
 * based search).
 * Worst case.... : k, where k = smallest integer such that 2**k > n
 * Average case.. : k -[(2**k -k-1)/n] = k-1 for large values of n
 * Example,n=1000 : W=10, A=9
 *
 *                         Binary tree search.
 * The binary search algorithm implicitly defines a tree structure (on the
 * stack) during the recursive activation of the search procedure.
 * This tree structure can be defined explicitly by incorporating a directed
 * binary graph (where each node has 2 pointers) in the table of keys.
 * The setuptime of the binary tree is larger than for the simple key table,
 * but the search is faster since arithmetic calculation is eliminated.
 * Furthermore the tree may be arranged in an "optimal" way to reflect the
 * expected frequency of searches for each key (placing the most frequent
 * keys near the root of the tree).
 * The basic performance characteristics of Binary tree search are identical
 * to those stated for Binary search, - searching  an "optimal" Binary tree
 * however may perform significantly better (depending on the "skewness" of
 * the searching frequency distribution of the keys).
 *
 *
 *                         Balanced tree search.
 * The performance measures of the Binary search algorithms described above
 * rely on the assumption that the search tree (implicit or explicit) is
 * well balanced, ie. all branches on the same level in the tree have
 * approximately the same number of descendants.
 * This assumption can not always be fulfilled : in the case of a dynamic
 * data store with many insertions and/or deletions a balanced tree quickly
 * degrades to a skewed datastructure (a "heap") with a bad worst-case
 * performance.
 *
 * The solution to this problem is to "re-balance" the tree whenever skewness
 * emerges, and several algorithms have been devised for this purpose :
 * the general idea is to allow more than 2 pointers per node in the tree
 * to get extra flexibility for the pointer reassignments of the rebalancing
 * operation. Some well known algorithms are AVL-trees, 2-3-4 trees and
 * the most general method known as B-trees (M keys per node).
 * This search strategy leads directly to the concept of index sequential
 * access method ("ISAM" files) and more complex hierachial databases.
 *
 *
 *                         Hashing
 * Binary search methods suffer from two general defects that limit their
 * usability in most simple applications :
 *    (1) the keyword entries have to be ordered (numerically/alphabetically)
 *    (2) the ordering implies restructuring of the data in case of updating
          by addition/deletion
 *
 * The search methods known as "hashing" (or scatter storage technique)
 * solves these two defects, - and usually perform better as well !
 * Hashing methods are based on the computers ability to do arithmetic at high
 * speeds. The idea is to treat the letters of words as if they were numbers
 * and then to "hash" (ie. scramble) the numbers in some way to generate a
 * single number for each word. In this way each key "maps" to a table address
 * (index) where the key has been stored, - if it is an element of the table!
 *
 *
 * =============================== HASHING ===================================
 *
 *
 * A hash function allows DIRECT REFERENCING of datablocks by using a simple
 * arithmetic transformation on the keys into table addresses. The hash table
 * may store the DATArecords directly, or use "indirect addressing" (ie. the
 * hashrecords store : the key + a POINTER to the datafile record).
 * The goal of hashing is to define a function, that will :
 *  - generate a FULL period (a mapping spanning the whole index range),
 *  - generate a UNIFORM mapping, ie. an even probability of mapping over the
 *    whole index range. The hash function should thus approximate a "random"
 *    function : it should perform as a fast (pseudo-) randomnumber generator
 *    mapping a large set of key-values into a smaller set of key-record
 *    index'es. Ideally the mapping should have the property that : h(K1) !=
 *    h(K2), so that different words K1 and K2 will hash directly to different
 *    addresses (so called "perfect hashing").
 *  - generate a UNIQUE mapping, ie. even keys hashing to the same initial
 *    index-value should trace different probing sequences during rehashing
 *  - perform FAST and be relatively easy to compute.
 *
 *                         Perfect hashing
 * If we know the key-values in advance, it is always possible to define a
 * SPECIALLY TAILORED "minimal perfect" (MP) hash function that will locate
 * any desired table element in a SINGLE probe without requiring extra space
 * in the table. A MP hash function uses a transformation based on a statis-
 * tical analysis of the actual set of key values :
 *  - (1) Digit analysis
 *    The distribution of values of the keys in each position or digit is
 *    determined. The positions with the most skewed distributions are then
 *    deleted from the key until the number of remaining digits is equal to
 *    the address length.
 *  - (2) Algebraic coding
 *    Each digit of a key is considered to be a polynomial coefficient. The
 *    polynomial so obtained is divided by another polynomial, which is
 *    invariant for all the keys. The coefficients of the remainder poly-
 *    nomial form the address. Based on the theory of error-correcting codes
 *    ("Hamming distances"), the dividing polynomial may be chosen to yield
 *    a UNIFORM mapping.
 *
 * MP hash functions are mostly of theoretical interest. In practice they are
 * used in situations, where we have a relatively short, static list of keys
 * (for instance reserved word lists of programming languages). Even in these
 * special cases, one often uses simpler methods such as :
 *  - setting up a table of carefully selected CODES derived from empirical
 *    tests of transforming the actual key-characters to unique index-values
 *    (as opposed to a complete statistical analysis)
 *  - using fast and simple arithmetic operations to obtain a "nearly minimal
 *    perfect" hash function with a single probe and a limited amount of extra
 *    /unused table space (as opposed to complex polynomial computations).
 *
 *
 *                         General hashing
 * Perfect hashing is seldom possible for longer lists of keywords : unless
 * the table size (m) is much larger than the number of keys (n), nearly all
 * GENERAL hash functions will lead to at least a few "collisions" between
 * values of h(Ki) and h(Kj).
 *
 *
 *                         Hash functions
 * General Hash functions must "SCRAMBLE" the key to obtain a more UNIFORM
 * mapping and "FOLD" the key-values onto the (smaller) set of index-values.
 * To obtain these goals, two basic functions have been used (with several
 * variations) : division and multiplication; - In practice one often uses a
 * combination of these methods :
 *
 *    (1) Division method
 *        H(key) = key MOD table-size
 *        where table-size must be prime.
 *         - Radix conversion
 *           Express the key in radix p, use : p MOD q**m as index.
 *           p and q must be relatively prime, and m a positive integer.
 *         - Folding and compression
 *           Divide ("fold") the key into smaller components - often separate
 *           characters - , and combine ("compress") these into a final index
 *           value, - for instance by ADD or XOR operations.
 *
 *    (2) Multiplication method
 *        H(key) = TRUNC( table-size * ((key * R) MOD 1) )
 *        where R : [0...1],  and ((key*R) MOD 1) = remainder of (key*R)
 *         - Mid-Square
 *           Multiply the key by itself (square), and extract the middle bits
 *           as index value.
 *         - Shifting
 *           A simple fold/compress-function does not take into account any
 *           permutation of key components (the order of characters). To
 *           counteract this kind of redundancy in the keyword set, we may use
 *           bit-shifting (=multiplication) of PARTS of the keyword before
 *           folding/compression.
 *
 *
 *                         Collision resolution.
 * Collisions are usually handled in one of two ways :
 *
 *    (1)  Indirect addressing ("chaining")
 *         Each entry of the table is treated as the first link in a chain of
 *         entries, all having keys that hash to the same value.
 *
 *    (2)  Open addressing ("rehashing")
 *         In case of collision we generate another hash code from the same
 *         key, and then reprobe the table (until key found/or empty entry) :
 *         REHASH(key, i) =  ( HASH(key) + F(i) ) MOD table-size.
 *         The reprobing term F(i) can be implemented in various ways to
 *         obtain (some of) these goals :
 *            (2.1) Linear probing
 *                  F(i) = a CONSTANT value added to the hash code each time.
 *                  To generate a FULL period either F(i) and table-size
 *                  should be "co-prime" (have no common factor), or the
 *                  table-size should be prime. Linear probing with F(i) = 1
 *                  degrades to a simple sequential search.
 *                  Linear probing is simple, but often produces "primary
 *                  clustering" (several sequences of collisions are stored
 *                  in the same range of hashindex locations).
 *            (2.2) Quadratic probing
 *                  F(i) = the EXPRESSION : (a + b*i + c * i**2), where a,b,c
 *                  are constants. This quadratic sequence yields more separated
 *                  chains of probes for keys hashing to nearby locations; -
 *                  however keys hashing to exactly the same location will
 *                  still trace the same probing sequence (known as "secondary
 *                  clustering"). Quadratic probing requires a table of size
 *                  of 2**m, - it won't search all locations if the table-size
 *                  is prime!
 *            (2.3) Double hashing
 *                  F(i) = the FUNCTION : (key MOD P2) + 1
 *                  By letting F(i) depend on the "key", we can effectively
 *                  reduce secondary clustering. The idea is to chose TWO
 *                  hash functions :
 *                     HASH(key) = key MOD tablesize -> [0...tablesize]
 *                     F(i) = 1+(key MOD (tablesize-2)) -> [1...tablesize-1]
 *                     REHASH(key) = (HASH(key) + F(i)) MOD tablesize
 *                  For this scheme to work, we must choose two "TWIN-PRIMES"
 *                  tablesize and tablesize-2 (example : 1021 and 1019).
 *            (2.4) Random probing
 *                  F(i) = a PSEUDO-RANDOM number generator producing a full,
 *                  uniform and unique mapping.
 *                  This is the ultimate solution to the collision problem,
 *                  but parameters for a well suited pseudo-random number
 *                  generator are not as easy to calculate, as those for a
 *                  good double hashing function. Furthermore the performance
 *                  of double hashing closely approximates random probing, so
 *                  solution 2.3 is often preferred for 2.4
 *
 *
 * ============================== DESIGN =====================================
 *
 *                     Primary design decisions
 * The primary goal of module hash.c has been to provide a set of SIMPLE and
 * yet GENERAL functions for building and using indexfiles as a means of fast
 * access to "flat" datafiles (arbitrary length records identified by uniqueue
 * keys) :
 *    (1)  SCATTER STORAGE indexing ("hashing") is preferred to the binary
 *         search techniques, thereby gaining speed in the general case of
 *         random access and index updating, at the cost of somewhat slower
 *         performance when sequential access is required.
 *
 *    (2)  GENERAL HASHING - as oposed to "perfect hashing" - is nessecitated
 *         by the dynamic characteristic of the datafiles (and as a conse-
 *         quence : our inability to determine the key-values in advance).
 *
 *    (3)  SEVERAL HASHING TRANSFORMATIONS & COLLISSION RESOLUTION ALGORITHMS
 *         have been provided in order to enable the user to select a method
 *         suited to the particular key-characteristic and datafile-size.
 *         Furthermore the module has been designed in a way that makes it
 *         very easy to "plug in" new algorithms for hashing and/or collision
 *         resolution, should the need to do so arise.
 *
 *
 *                     Choice of hash algorithms
 * Guidelines for the selection of a proper hashing strategy is stated below:
 *
 * (1) Hashing transformation.
 * GENERAL hash transformations must all be "distribution independent", ie.
 * the transformations can not take into account the actual distribution of
 * keys over the key space (since the datafiles are not known in advance!).
 * In many/most cases the key-distributions are NOT uniform, resulting in
 * more collisions in "dense" areas of the key-space, - regardless of which
 * hashing transformation we use!
 * Practical studies as well as theoretical analysis thus indicate that -
 * faced with an arbitrary key set - the choice of hashing transformation is
 * of less importance than a good collision resolution method.  Only one
 * general conclusion can be made [Lum 71/73]: A hash-transformation based
 * on division gives the best overall performance. All of the following
 * functions include a division : MOD by the (prime) size of the indextable:
 * +-------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
 * | METHOD:                 |            Characteristic                    |
 * +-------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
 * | FLL (First+Last+Length) | fast, NOT suited for fixed-length keys       |
 * | ADD (Sum of chars)      | fast, NOT good if many key-permutations      |
 * | PJW (P.J.Weinburger)    | slower (approx. 10 x ADD), more general      |
 * +-------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
 * The time needed to calculate the hash function is not important in the
 * context of this module, where the index'es are kept on secondary storage
 * (disk access time is a factor 10-100 x slower than a hash calculation).
 * We therefore choose P.J.WEINBURGER (PJW) as default hashing transformation.
 *
 * (2) Collision resolution :
 * Let n=number of keys, m=number of slots in index, L="Loadfactor"=n/m <= 1.
 * The number of probes required to look up a key in a hash index is then a
 * function of the Loadfactor, as stated in the following table :
 * +-------------+--------------------------------------+-------------------+
 * |      METRIC:|              # Probes                |  Examples: A W    |
 * | METHOD:     | Average (A)     | Worstcase (W)      | L=0.5   | L=0.75  |
 * +-------------+-----------------+--------------------+---------+---------+
 * | Chaining    | 1 + L/2         | e**(-L) + L        | 1.3 1.4 | 1.1 1.2 |
 * | Linear Prob.| [1 + 1/(1-L)]/2 | [1 + 1/(1-L)**2]/2 | 1.5 2.5 | 2.5 8.5 |
 * | Double Hash.| -[ln(1-L)] / L  | 1 / (1-L)          | 1.4 1.8 | 2.0 4.0 |
 * +-------------+-----------------+--------------------+---------+---------+
 * In general hashing provides VERY FAST CONSTANT search times for L < 0.75,
 * ie. when space is available for a large enough table; - Contrast this to
 * linear search with O=n and binary search with O=log2(n). Note however that
 * the performance degrades rapidly, as the index fills up (L approaches 1).
 * When this happens, the index should be resized to obtain a lower L factor.
 *
 * Chain-based lookup compares favorably to the other collision resolution
 * strategies, but implies maintenance of linked lists; - this method is well
 * suited for RAM-based index'es (dynamic storage allocation) with a high data
 * "turnover rate" and an unpredictable number of keys and updates. It is
 * however inconvenient for more static index'es placed on secondary storage.
 * (Chaining is NOT offered as a collision resolution method in this module).
 *
 * Linear probing is simple to compute, and the method may be preferable for
 * small index'es with a low loadfactor. For larger index'es the overhead
 * imposed by double hashing is justified by a reduced collision rate.
 * We make DOUBLE HASHING the default choice for collision resolution.
 *
 *
 *                     Multiuser considerations
 * The file access methods for the hash functions in this module have been
 * designed with the following goals in mind :
 *  1  SINGLE USER exclusive access to multiple dynamic hash index'es
 *     with full (READ/WRITE) permissions.
 *     This option may be used by a system administrator in a multiuser
 *     environment to create and maintain hash index'es for subsequent
 *     sharing by multiple end-users (cf. pt. 2)
 *  2  MULTIUSER concurrent access to multiple static hash index'es
 *     with limited (READ-ONLY) permissions.
 *
 * TRUE MULTIUSER access with full permissions on hash index'es has NOT
 * been implemented;  This requires some changes to the design :
 *  -  the code in the basic hash index write-functions (cf. eWriteIdxHdr,
 *     eWriteIdxKey) must be "sandwich'ed" between statements for locking
 *     resp. unlocking the range of bytes to be updated in the file (ie.
 *     setting up "critical regions" for the basic record-write operations).
 *     Nb: lock/unlock-functions have not been standardized by ANSI/ISO,
 *     so a generic interface should be implemented to hide system dependency.
 *  -  the simple method of checking a "boolean" integrity value (indicating
 *     proper close of the index) must be substituted by a multivalued
 *     integrity variable : a count of open-operations on the index-file.
 *     Updating of the index (cf. eHashKeyInsert, eHashKeyDelete) may then
 *     be allowed - accompanied by appending of datarecords to the datafile.
 *     Nb: any restructuring of the datafile or of the hash index (cf.
 *     eHashIdxResize) should not take place while users are "on line".
 *
 *
 * ============================== MODULE STRUCTURE ===============================
 *
 *                     Data model
 * To define a hashtable on disk and in core we need some datastructures for
 * size- & statusinfo (one HEADER-record) and for index-values (multiple
 * KEY-records). These data must be maintained both on disk and in RAM.
 * The appropriate data-structures are defined in the include-file HASH.H.
 *                             
 * (1) Header-record layout
 *
 *     DISK (external)                     RAM (incore)

 *     +-------------------+           +-------------------+
 *
 *
 *
 *                     Function decomposition
 * The index functions to generate and access these data structures may be
 * grouped into 3 broad categories : Header operations, Key-record operations
 * and low level index-file I/O. The main calling hierachy is outlined in the
 * following diagram :
 * 
 * (1) Index header operations     (2) Index key operations

/* DESCRIPTION
 *    Testdriver for module hash.c; - exercises the functions in the module
 *    and validates the functionality through trace-statements when compiled
 *    with flag "DEBUG".
 *
 *   1: Print signon message & setup to catch "break" signals.
 *
 *   2: MAKE and fill a new hash index ... :
 *      2.1: Create & open the new hash index (Read/Write mode), -
 *           actions 2.x are skipped, if the indexfile already exists.
 *      2.2: Print initial statistics for the index (size & loadfactor).
 *      2.3: Fill the hashindex file with: (key,offset) records,
 *           build by scanning the datafile.
 *      2.4: Print final statistics for the index (size & loadfactor).
 *      2.5: Print all (defined) keyrecord entries in the indexfile.
 *      2.6: Close the hash index gracefully, - NB: the indexfile MUST be
 *           closed properly to preserve the index integrity in RW mode!
 *
 *   3: TEST the hash index by looking up entries in the index file ... :
 *      3.1: Open the existing hash index (ReadOnly mode).
 *     [3.2: Optionally print all (defined) keyrecord entries,
 *           - this function may take some time.]
 *      3.3: LOOP : Enter keyvalue, lookup in hashindex file, print keyrecord
 *           UNTILL empty keyvalue entered
 *      3.4: Close the hash index gracefully
 *
 * RETURN
 *   REAL_MAIN() is a testdriver and not intented to interface with any
 *   calling program. The return value from REAL_MAIN() is thus insignificant
 *   in this context.
 *   You should however notice the checking of error-conditions on return
 *   from each call to a PUBLIC function defined in hash.c; - This practice
 *   should also be followed in your application to "catch" and diagnose any
 *   malfunction in the system or in the services provided by this module.
 *   (You will probably want to write your own error-handling, though).
 *
 * EXAMPLE
 *   The contents of function REAL_MAIN() demonstrates the basic aspects of
 *   building and accessing a hashindex using the *LOW LEVEL* public data-
 *   structures and interface-functions in HASH.C/H.
 *   The modules INDEX.C/H and KEY.C/H provides more *HIGL LEVEL* interfaces
 *   for generating and using indexfiles from application programs.
 *
 * SEE ALSO
 *   hash.h for a detailed description of symbolic constants, macro's,
 *   data structures, return codes and error codes.

/* DESCRIPTION
 *    Opens an already existing hash-index file in the current directory on
 *    disk with the name of "pzIdxFile" and the open-mode of "pzAccess".
 *    Valid modes are : "rb" (ReadOnly access) and "w+b" (ReadWrite access).
 *
 *    1: Opens an existing hash index "pzIdxFile" in mode "pzAccess" ("rb"/"w+b")
 *    2: Allocates an "in core" hashindex descriptor structure (struct stHcore)
 *       and points the handle passed as parameter (HASH* pH) to this structure.
 *       (The initial parameter-value of the handle is assumed to be NULL).
 *    3: Verifies the hash index header record by calculating a CCITT-CRC of
 *       the embedded struct stHsize, and compares this value with a previ-
 *       ously calculated checksum (also stored in the header).
 *    4: Initializes the "in core" hash index descriptor with basic file
 *       information : open-status, filename, filesize.
 *    5: Verifies the hash index file "integrity" field, which indicates a
 *       succesful close-operation after a Read/Write acces to the hash index.
 *       If the hash index has not been closed properly (bad CRC), the
 *       function restores the essential size-information in the file header.
 *       NB: The integrity-verification is designed for SingleUser creation,
 *       and maintenamce of hashindex'es in acces-mode ReadWrite; - it does
 *       NOT apply (and is not relevant) for multiuser acces in ReadOnly mode.
 *    6: Patch, for "double hashing". This hashing method requires a set of
 *       "twin primes": the table size (T) for hashing, and T-2 for rehashing.
 * RETURN

 *                      D. H. Lehmer's algorithm.
 *    The generating function :   f(X) = a*X mod m
 *    gives a repeated sequence (cycle, period) of statistically independent
 *    random numbers, with appropriate choice of :
 *    modulus  m : should be large, to permit a LONG period
 *                 should be prime, to permit a FULL period (cf multiplier a)
 *    multipl. a : should be a "primitive root" of prime m to permit a FULL
 *                 period, ie. :   a**(m-1) mod m = 1 (Fermats theorem).
 *    The following choice of parameters passes tests of random distribution
 *    and permits implementation with 32-bit arithmetic (C "long" data type) :
 *                    m   =   (2**31 - 1) =   2147483647
 *                    a   =   (7**5)      =   16807
 *                    X0  =   initial seed in the range [ 1 ... (m-1) ]
 *    The PMMLCG with these parameters is recommended as a minimal standard
 *    for a reliable and portable random number generator (see references).
 *
 *                      Schrage's Method.
 *    An algorithm, that evaluates expressions in the PMMLCG in such a way,
 *    that all intermediate results are bounded by (m-1).
 *    Given :     f(X)    =   a*X mod m
 *                        =   a*X - m ( a*X div m )
 *    we can use an "approximate" factoring of m : 	m = aq + r
 *    with the quotient q = (m div a) and the rest r = (m mod a)
 *    to transcribe f(X) to :
 *                f(X)    =   a(X mod q) -  r(X div q) +
 *                            (X div q) - (a*X div m)

/* DESCRIPTION
 *    This routine generates the 16-bit remainder of a block of data, using
 *    the 16-bit CCITT polynomial generator. The basic idea is to treat the
 *    entire message as a (rather long) binary number; the crc checksum is
 *    then obtained by taking the one's complement of the remainder after the
 *    modulo 2 division by a generator polynomial.
 *                           16   12   5
 *    The CCITT-CRC uses: ( X  + X  + X + 1 ) for the generator polynomial.
 *    This may also be expressed as :  position   16   12        5     0
 *     - in binary :                               1 0001 0000 0010 0001

 *    In computing the crc, a 17-bit dataregister is simulated by testing the
 *    MSB before shifting the data. This affords us the luxury of specifying
 *    the polynomial as a 16-bit value : 0x1021.
 *    The crc is generated in "LSB->MSB" order, so the bits of the polynomial
 *    are also stored in reverse order : 0x8408.
 * RETURN
 *    16-bit CCITT-reverse of block pointed to by pzData, length wLength byte.
